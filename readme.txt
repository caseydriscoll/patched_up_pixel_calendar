A widget that produces a responsive, minimalist 'raster' calendar of pixels of all of your posts from the last year.

== Description ==

Patched Up Pixel Calendar is a minimalist 'raster' pixel calendar widget for your blog. It queries all posts from the last 365 days and caches the results as a transient. The transient is updated every 24 hours, when a new post is saved, or when the widget settings are changed.

Each 'pixel' in the calendar is a link to that day's archive page. The color of the pixel (its opacity) is intesified for every post on that day. On hover, a tooltip displays the names of each post from that day.

The pixel calendar was heavily influenced by the Github 'Contributions Calendar' on every users' profile page. However, that is built in canvas and js and this plugin is pure html and css.

The html produced is 100% responsive without the aid of any javascript or images.

== Installation ==

Installation is very simple

1. Upload the 'patched_up_pixel_calendar/' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
